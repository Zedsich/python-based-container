# python-based-container
A simple implementation of container based on python

## Usage
```bash
$ sudo python3 python-container.py run /bin/bash
```
## Adaptation
Add one adapted version: `python-container-v2.py`

You can check your `Cgroup version` by using the following command:

```bash
$ sudo docker info
```

You will find yours like `Cgroup Version: 1` or ` Cgroup Version: 2`
